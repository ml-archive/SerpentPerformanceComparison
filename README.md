**üêç [Serpent](https://github.com/nodes-ios/Serpent)** *(previously known as Serializable)* is a framework made by us at [Nodes](https://nodesagency.com) for creating model objects or structs that can be easily serialized and deserialized from/to JSON. 

It's designed to be used together with our helper app, the [![ModelBoiler](http://i.imgur.com/V5UzMVk.png)](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler) [Model Boiler](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler), making model creation a breeze.

**In this repo we compare Serpent with other popular JSON mapping frameworks.**

# Serpent Performance Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison)

So how fast is Serpent? Why should I use Serpent instead of one of the many other Encoding/Decoding frameworks out there? What features does Serpent lack?

*Let's find out!* (or, you can [skip to the results](#-the-results))

**Note:** All of the following can be found in the [Performance Tests](https://github.com/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison/blob/master/SerpentComparisonTests/SerpentComparisonTests.swift) in this repo. 

## üìú The Data
We need something big to test. Parsing a small 10-line JSON object doesn't help illustrate performance. So let's see how it does with an object like this: 

~~~
{
	"id": "56cf043e934a463a49375405"
	"index" : 0,
	"guid": "8dfb0059-93fc-4369-83a8-60cbad659d5f",
	"isActive": true,
	"balance": "$3,976.78",
	"picture": "http://placehold.it/32x32",
	"age": 22,
	"eyeColor": "green",
	"name": {
		"last": "Workman",
		"first": "Rhonda"
	},
	"company": "PLASMOSIS",
	"email": "rhonda.workman@plasmosis.co.uk",
	"phone": "+1 (823) 453-2185",
	"address": "311 Scott Avenue, Maplewood, Kansas, 2955",
	"about": "Commodo veniam pariatur ea ut duis incididunt. Eiusmod consequat quis ex consequat cillum exercitation enim voluptate eiusmod aliquip. Sunt dolor ea cillum nisi commodo aliqua velit dolor. Ad incididunt sint est consequat eiusmod laboris anim aute velit dolore ut ea sint Lorem. Tempor consectetur incididunt minim sunt ipsum velit ut et duis occaecat enim. Est exercitation eiusmod mollit incididunt occaecat occaecat do. Laboris ea enim eu dolor duis est occaecat est enim amet proident id.",
	"registered": "Saturday, June 6, 2015 9:22 AM",
	"latitude": "16.640946",
	"longitude": "-122.190771",
	"greeting": "Hello, Rhonda! You have 7 unread messages.",
	"favoriteFruit": "strawberry"
}

~~~

A good mix of types, there are `Int`, `String`, `Enum`, `NSURL`, and nested objects. But again, this isn't enough for useful metrics. [So lets use 10,000 of these](https://github.com/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison/blob/master/SerpentComparisonTests/PerformanceTest.json). A 10.1 MB file should be good enough. 

Let's also test 10,000 of a smaller object as well, to see how that impacts performance:

~~~
{
	"id": "56cf0c0c4d93367b1d9282b3",
	"name": "Catherine"
}
~~~

[This file](https://github.com/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison/blob/master/SerpentComparisonTests/PerformanceSmallTest.json) is only 6% of the bigger file's size.


## üíø The Models

So let's create our models now. We want to make the data as useful as possible, so we should use the appropriate data types when possible (not just using `String` for everything). 

~~~swift
struct PerformanceTestModel {	
	enum EyeColor: String {
		case Blue = "blue"
		case Green = "green"
		case Brown = "brown"
	}	
	enum Fruit: String {
		case Apple = "apple"
		case Banana = "banana"
		case Strawberry = "strawberry"
	}	
	var id = ""
	var index = 0
	var guid = ""
	var isActive = true 
	var balance = ""
	var picture: NSURL?
	var age = 0
	var eyeColor: EyeColor = .Brown 
	var name = Name()
	var company = ""
	var email = ""
	var phone = ""
	var address = ""
	var about = ""
	var registered = ""
	var latitude = 0.0
	var longitude = 0.0
	var greeting = ""
	var favoriteFruit: Fruit? 
}
struct Name {
	var first = ""
	var last = ""
}
~~~

~~~swift
struct PerformanceTestSmallModel {	
	var id = ""
	var name = ""
}
~~~

Serpent doesn't care if you use implicit or explicit types, so it is only added when needed (for `Enum`, nested types, or optionals, for example). Also, we could of course use optionals for these fields instead of default values (`favoriteFruit` vs. `eyeColor`, for example). 


## üìè The Tests

So now we want to parse the JSON into this model. With Serpent, this is done by conforming to `Decodable` and implementing `init(dictionary:NSDictionary?)` (all done automatically in a split-second if you use our [![ModelBoiler](http://i.imgur.com/V5UzMVk.png)](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler) [Model Boiler](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler)): 

~~~swift
extension PerformanceTestModel: Serializable {
	init(dictionary: NSDictionary?) {
		id            <== (self, dictionary, "id")
		index         <== (self, dictionary, "index")
		guid          <== (self, dictionary, "guid")
		isActive      <== (self, dictionary, "isActive")
		balance       <== (self, dictionary, "balance")
		picture       <== (self, dictionary, "picture")
		age           <== (self, dictionary, "age")
		eyeColor      <== (self, dictionary, "eyeColor")
		name          <== (self, dictionary, "name")
		company       <== (self, dictionary, "company")
		email         <== (self, dictionary, "email")
		phone         <== (self, dictionary, "phone")
		address       <== (self, dictionary, "address")
		about         <== (self, dictionary, "about")
		registered    <== (self, dictionary, "registered")
		latitude      <== (self, dictionary, "latitude")
		longitude     <== (self, dictionary, "longitude")
		greeting      <== (self, dictionary, "greeting")
		favoriteFruit <== (self, dictionary, "favoriteFruit")
	}
}
~~~

Now PerformanceTestModel is ready to decode some JSON. Since loading the raw JSON data isn't something Serpent (or any other similar framework) is concerned with, we don't need to test the performance of that, so we'll just load the data like this:

~~~swift
override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        if let path = Bundle(for: type(of: self)).path(forResource: "PerformanceTest", ofType: "json"), let data = NSData(contentsOfFile: path) {
            largeData = data
        }
        if let path = Bundle(for: type(of: self)).path(forResource: "PerformanceSmallTest", ofType: "json"), let data = NSData(contentsOfFile: path) {
            smallData = data
        }
    }
~~~

Normally, we would also parse this JSON data into a dictionary using `NSJSONSerialization`, but some frameworks have their own JSON parsing logic, so we'll measure the performance of the parsing as well as decoding. 

So let's test it!

~~~swift
func testSerpentBig() {
        self.measure { () -> Void in
            do {
                self.jsonDict = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: self.largeData as Data, options: .allowFragments) as? NSDictionary
                let _ = PerformanceTestModel.array(self.jsonDict["data"])
            }
            catch {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
    
    func testSerpentSmall() {
        self.measure {
            do {
                self.smallJsonDict = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: self.smallData as Data, options: .allowFragments) as? NSDictionary
                let _ = PerformanceTestSmallModel.array(self.smallJsonDict["data"])
            }
            catch {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
~~~

## üìä The Results

**Note:** All of these tests are run on an iPhone 6S after a clean build.

Test |¬†Result
---|---
Serpent Large Model |¬†0.692 sec
Serpent Small Model |¬†0.084 sec


Not too bad for 10,000 objects. 

But how does it compare to other frameworks? We looked at 8 other popular frameworks to compare our results: [Freddy](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Freddy), [Gloss](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss), [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper), [JSONCodable](https://github.com/matthewcheok/JSONCodable), [Unbox](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Unbox), [Decodable](https://github.com/Anviking/Decodable), [Marshal](https://github.com/utahiosmac/Marshal) and [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) in Apples Foundation framework.

Before we can compare results, we have a few issues to resolve. Freddy only supports primitive types and collections, so no `Enum`, `NSURL`, or odd cases (such as the latitude and longitude fields, which are `String` in the JSON but `Double` in our model). Others can't handle the `NSURL`. So to be fair, we'll remove those properties from the test. 

**Later edit**: We also got PRs that added the following frameworks: [Marshal](https://github.com/utahiosmac/Marshal) (thanks to [bre7](https://github.com/bre7)).

**Note:** If you're curious about the usage of the other frameworks, you can have a look at [the test file](https://github.com/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison/blob/master/SerpentComparisonTests/SerpentComparisonTests.swift). 

Test |¬†Large Model |¬†Small Model
---|---|---
Serpent 	   |¬†0.711 sec |¬†0.085 sec
Freddy       |¬†0.670 sec |¬†0.097 sec
Gloss        |¬†2.682 sec |¬†0.360 sec
ObjectMapper |¬†2.279 sec |¬†0.348 sec
JSONCodable  |¬†4.363 sec |¬†0.510 sec
Unbox		   |¬†3.102 sec |¬†0.372 sec
Decodable	   |¬†1.642 sec |¬†0.215 sec
Marshal	   | 0.528 sec | 0.096 sec
Codable	   | 1.233 sec<sup>1</sup> | 0.204 sec<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> The measurements for Codable were last made using Xcode 9 beta 1.

*The tests were last run locally on device on 8 March 2017. Here's the [full output](testsOutput.log)*
 
We're running those performance tests on CI too, so you can see the latest results on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison). The times on Travis are different, but the general picture is the same. 

Here's a chart with the results from the tests ran on an iPhone 6S after a clean build on 8 March 2017. Lower is better.

![Results chart](chart.png)


#### So what does this mean?

When it comes to mapping, **Marshal** is the fastest, followed by **Freddy** and **Serpent** (the order between Freddy and Serpent varies from one test to another and we'd say is pretty negligible). Overall, all three frameworks performed way better than the others.


## üìà Feature Comparison

So you've seen the performance tests, but what about features?

<sup>2</sup> Marshal and Codable supports NSURL, doesn't support UIColor, but you can manually create extensions that will parse it.
<sup>3</sup> The Swift compiler can automatically synthesize the two protocols Encodable and Decodable which constitute the Codable protcool.


## üè∑ TL;DR
Serpent meets the best balance between speed and its number of features. But don't take our word for it, try it out and see for yourself! And don't forget, we have the [![ModelBoiler](http://i.imgur.com/V5UzMVk.png)](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler) [Model Boiler](https://github.com/nodes-ios/ModelBoiler), which saves loads of time and makes your life much easier. 

## üí™ Contributing

We know there are other JSON mapping frameworks out there. We would like to add more of them to this comparison, so its results are even more reflective of the current JSON mapping framework environment. However, we don't have a specific timeline for adding more libraries. We gladly accept Pull Requests to this repo that add other frameworks for the comparison. 

In order to be merged, a PR that adds a new JSON mapping framework:

- must add the new framework via Carthage
- must not break any of the other framework's usage implementation
- must add performance tests that use the same data as the others (it's ok to add new json data for testing as long as you run the same tests for all the frameworks)
- must edit the correctness test to check that the parsing is correct for the new mapping framework added
- must not break the CI build

We want those tests to be as fair as possible and to have the same conditions for all the frameworks that we test.  

We reserve the right to close issues that only say "Please add `<insert_mapping_framework_name_here>` to your tests", without a PR that adds that library. We don't want the [issues](https://github.com/nodes-ios/SerpentPerformanceComparison/issues) of this repo to turn into a list of all the JSON mapping frameworks available. But we're very happy for pull requests ü§ì

#### Running this locally
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios` (If you don't have Carthage installed, you can [install it like this](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage))
3. Open the project in Xcode
4. Run the tests (Product -> Test, or ‚åò-U)
5. See the results in the debug console
